# GitPub
## About
A service to allow anonymous PubSubHubbub compliant subscriptions to GitHub repos.

## Why
GitHub allows you to create WebHooks for your repo but you need to be a contributor to that repo and it is not fully [PubSubHubbub compliant](https://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/git/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html) -- GitHub does not verify the subscription.
GitPub makes use of GitHub's WebHooks service to listen for push requests on subscribed repos and then publishes them to its own subscribers.
